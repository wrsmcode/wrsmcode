### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I love OpenSource and am an advocate of its use. Knowledge is power and power to those who know how to use it. Knowledge alone is absurd and doesn't help anyone. I enjoy teaching and explaining.
What is the point of expensive tech software if only bugs and errors annoy customers?
The answer from such companies is usually: it's not a bug, it's a feature!
suck off!
